## ✅ Foundation Complete - Ready for Implementation

This upgrade plan provides a systematic approach to improving the ReactoryForm component while maintaining backward compatibility and minimizing risk. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a stable and robust upgrade process.

### ✅ Phase 0 Foundation Complete

The feature flags foundation has been successfully implemented, providing:
- ✅ Robust feature flag system for gradual rollouts
- ✅ Comprehensive React hooks for feature management
- ✅ TypeScript support with all type issues resolved
- ✅ Testing infrastructure with 161 passing tests
- ✅ Documentation and examples ready for use

### ✅ Phase 1 Foundation & Stability - 50% Complete

Phase 1 is progressing well with two sub-phases completed:
- ✅ Phase 1.1: Type System Overhaul completed
- ✅ Phase 1.2: Error Handling Enhancement completed
