## Detailed Phase Status

### Phase 0: Feature Flags Foundation

**Status**: ✅ Written, ⚠️ Partially Integrated  
**Date**: 2024-08-01

A TypeScript feature flag library (`@zepz/feature-flags-ts`) was created with:
- Memory and API providers
- React hooks (`useFeatureFlag`, `useSimpleFeatureFlag`, `useApiFeatureFlag`, `useMemoryFeatureFlag`)
- 161 tests passing

Feature flag constants were defined in `FEATURE_FLAGS.md` for all 6 upgrade phases. However,
no form code imports or checks these flags at runtime. The flag system is available but unused.

---

### Phase 1.1: Type System Overhaul

**Status**: ✅ Written, ⚠️ Partially Integrated  
**Date**: 2024-08-01

**Files created**:
- `types-v2.ts` — Enhanced type definitions (~643 lines)
- `typeValidation.ts` — Runtime validation utilities
- `typeTests.ts` — Test suite

**What's integrated**: Only the error-related types (`ReactoryComponentError` with extended
fields) are imported by `ErrorBoundary.tsx`, `ReactoryFormEnhanced.tsx`, and `useErrorHandling.ts`.

**What's NOT integrated**: Runtime validators (`isValidFormState`, `isValidSchema`, etc.),
type guards, enhanced paging types, enhanced hook result metadata.

---

### Phase 1.2: Error Handling Enhancement

**Status**: ✅ Written AND Integrated  
**Date**: 2024-08-01

**Files created and in production**:
- `ErrorBoundary.tsx` — Wraps form with try/catch, retry, user-friendly error display
- `errorLogging.ts` — Error persistence and statistics
- `hooks/useErrorHandling.ts` — Error classification, retry, recovery strategies

**Integration**: `ReactoryFormEnhanced.tsx` imports all three. The enhanced form IS the
production export and wraps every `ReactoryForm` instance.

---

### Phase 1.3: State Management Refactoring

**Status**: ✅ Written, ❌ Not Integrated  
**Date**: 2024-08-01

**Files created**:
- `stateManagement/useStateStore.ts` — Centralized store with persistence, immutability, migration
- `stateManagement/useStateDebugger.ts` — State history, inspection, debugging tools
- `stateManagementTests.ts` — Test suite

**Reality**: Zero production imports. The form still uses its original state pattern via
`useFormDefinition` and `useDataManager`. These hooks are completely standalone.

---

### Phase 1.4: Performance Optimization (Foundation)

**Status**: ✅ Written, ❌ Not Integrated  
**Date**: 2024-08-01

**Files created**:
- `performanceOptimization/usePerformanceMonitor.ts`
- `performanceOptimization/useVirtualScrolling.ts`
- `performanceOptimization/useIntelligentCache.ts`
- `performanceOptimization/useMemoryManager.ts`
- `performanceOptimizationTests.ts`

**Reality**: Zero production imports. These are standalone hooks with no connection to the
form's rendering or data pipeline.

---

### Phase 2.1: Rendering Performance

**Status**: ✅ Written, ❌ Not Integrated  
**Date**: 2024-08-01

**Files created**:
- `phase2/useVirtualFormList.ts` — Virtual scrolling for form lists
- `phase2/useMemoizedFormField.ts` — Field memoization with props comparison
- `phase2/useLazyFormComponent.ts` — Lazy loading for heavy components
- `phase2/phase2RenderingTests.ts`
- `phase2/phase2ImplementationTests.js`
- `phase2/phase2ImplementationRunner.js`

**Reality**: Zero production imports. None of these hooks are called by `useFormDefinition`,
`useDataManager`, or `ReactoryForm.tsx`.

---

### Phase 2.2: Data Management Optimization

**Status**: ✅ Written, ❌ Not Integrated  
**Date**: 2024-08-01

**Files created**:
- `phase2/useIntelligentCache.ts` — LRU caching with compression
- `phase2/useDataPrefetching.ts` — Behavioral analysis and priority queuing
- `phase2/useGraphQLOptimization.ts` — Query batching, deduplication, caching
- `phase2/useOfflineSupport.ts` — Sync queue with conflict resolution
- `phase2/phase2DataManagementTests.ts`

**Reality**: Zero production imports. The GraphQL data manager uses its own implementation
without these optimization hooks.

---

### Phase 2.3: Memory Management

**Status**: ❌ Not Started

No implementation files exist.

---

### Phase 3: Visual & UX Improvements

**Status**: ✅ Written, ❌ Not Integrated  
**Date**: 2024-08-01

**Files created**:
- `phase3/animations/formAnimations.ts` — Framer Motion animation configs
- `phase3/components/ModernFormField.tsx` — Animated form fields with floating labels
- `phase3/components/LoadingSkeleton.tsx` — Animated loading skeletons
- `phase3/components/EnhancedReactoryForm.tsx` — Wraps base form with all Phase 3 features
- Test files in `phase3/tests/`

**Reality**: `EnhancedReactoryForm.tsx` (Phase 3) imports and uses the other Phase 3
components internally, but it is never imported by the main codebase. It's a self-contained
prototype.

**Note**: The name `EnhancedReactoryForm` is confusing because `ReactoryFormEnhanced.tsx`
(the Phase 1.2 error-handling wrapper) is the ACTUAL production component. The Phase 3
`EnhancedReactoryForm` is a DIFFERENT, unused component.

---

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

**Status**: ✅ Written, ❌ Not Integrated  
**Date**: 2024-08-01

#### 4.1 Real-time Collaboration
- `phase4/collaboration/useRealTimeCollaboration.ts` — WebSocket-based collaboration
- `phase4/collaboration/PresenceIndicators.tsx` — User presence UI
- `phase4/collaboration/CollaborationToolbar.tsx` — Collaboration controls
- Tests: 24 tests (11 passing per docs)

#### 4.2 Advanced Validation
- `phase4/validation/useAdvancedValidation.ts` — Async, cross-field, custom validators
- `phase4/validation/ValidationDisplay.tsx` — Error/warning visualization
- Tests: 29 tests (18 passing per docs)

#### 4.3 Form Builder
- `phase4/builder/useFormBuilder.ts` — Drag-and-drop builder hook
- `phase4/builder/FormBuilderCanvas.tsx` — Visual canvas with grid/rulers/zoom
- Tests: 28 tests (all passing per docs)

#### 4.4 Form Editor
- Spec written in `FORM_EDITOR_SPEC.md`
- No implementation code exists

**Reality**: All Phase 4 code has zero production imports. Test suites exist but some have
failing tests (collaboration: 11/24, validation: 18/29).

---

### Phases 5–6: Developer Experience & Architecture

**Status**: ❌ Not Started

No implementation files exist for any Phase 5 or Phase 6 task.

## What IS Actually in Production

The production `ReactoryForm` component uses these from the upgrade work:

1. **ReactoryFormEnhanced.tsx** — Error boundary wrapper (Phase 1.2)
2. **ErrorBoundary.tsx** — Error boundary component (Phase 1.2)
3. **errorLogging.ts** — Error log persistence (Phase 1.2)
4. **hooks/useErrorHandling.ts** — Error classification & retry (Phase 1.2)
5. **types-v2.ts** — Error-related types + ReactoryFormState (Phase 1.1, partial)
6. **components/FormLoadingIndicator.tsx** — Multi-stage loading UI
7. **hooks/useFormLoadingState.tsx** — Loading stage tracker
8. **hooks/useContext.ts** — Form context builder (rebuilt from stub, replaces inline getFormContext)
9. **stateManagement/useStateStore.ts** — Centralized state (Phase 1.3, feature-flagged)
10. **performanceOptimization/usePerformanceMonitor.ts** — Performance monitoring (Phase 1.4, feature-flagged)
11. **DataManagers/useRESTDataManager.ts** — REST data manager (fully implemented)
12. **ReactoryForm.tsx** — ARIA accessibility attributes added

Items 9-10 are feature-flagged and inactive by default. Items 11-12 are always active.

Remaining unintegrated: Phases 2.x, 3.x, 4.x exist as standalone code.
